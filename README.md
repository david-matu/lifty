### Simulate Lift (Elevator) System
`Dec 27, 2022`

This hobby project is inspired by the wonderful elevator systems that are in work in 
most elevated buildings. It is not an aim to re-invent the system and it's not really upto 
improvement of the existing lift systems. There is no previous access to elevator codes. 
It is just pure motivation gained from observation and use of Lifts. `~Dave`
