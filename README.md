### Simulate Lift (Elevator) System
`Dec 27, 2022`

This is hobby project is inspired by the wonderful elevator systems that are in work in 
most elevated buildings. It's not an aim to invent a new system and not really upto 
improvement of the existing lift systems. This is purely a hobby. `~Dave`
